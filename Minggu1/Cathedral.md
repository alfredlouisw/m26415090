iness has changed. Much of world runs on "Open Source" software--even the largest software companies have had to admit that they run such software in their own operations, and may even sell products with Open Source code in it. Hackers (expert programmers--NOT the same as "crackers," who are criminals) work on their own time to produce and improve "free" software. This is possible because the source code is freely open to all, and because of the Internet--which is only fair, since it is Open Source software that makes the Internet possible. Raymond knows--and is part of--the revolution. In October 1999, a collection of his essays was published explaining the phenomenon. In true Open Source fashion, hackers responded to him, clarifying, adding, updating, and this new, revised, and expanded book, published only 15 months later, is the result. It will not teach one how to be a programmer, but it will give insight into how Open Source projects develop, the qualities of their leaders, and the rewards required by the hackers themselves. An important work for business people as well as computer scientists. All levels. R. P. Sarna Maine Maritime Academy
