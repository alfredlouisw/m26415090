This opens the filename for reading. 

By default, the file is opened with the "r" parameter. 
fh = open("filename_here", "r")

This opens the fhe file for writing. 

It will create the file if it doesn't exist, and if it does, it will overwrite
it.
fh =open("filename_here", "w")

This opens the fhe file in appending mode. 

That means, it will be open for writing and everything will be written to the
end of the file.
fh =open("filename_here", "a")

#This closes the file and is used when the program doesn't need it more. 
fh.close()
Read, Readline and Readlines
Functions available for reading the files: read, readline and readlines. 
Read
The read function reads all characters (unless you specify other)
fh = open("filename", "r")

content = fh.read()
Readline
The readline function reads a single line from the file
fh = open("filename", "r")

content = fh.readline()
Readlines
The readlines function returns a list containing all the lines of data in the
file.

The readlines function reads all rows and retains the newlines character that is
at the end of every row.
fh = open("filename", "r")

content = fh.readlines()

print content.rstrip() or

print content[:-1]
Write and Writelines
The functions for writing are write and writelines
Write
To write a fixed sequence of characters to a file
fh = open("hello.txt","w")

write("Hello World")

Writeline
With the writeline function you can write a list of strings to a file
fh = open("hello.txt", "w")

lines_of_text = ["a line of text", "another line of text", "a third line"]

fh.writelines(lines_of_text)
